#INSERT DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS    
    First the user runs the program. Once run, the command window will display a prompt
explaining the options of values to enter into the program. First it will ask the user
to enter an input amount, which must be entered as a float(ex. 20.02). The user is then
asked to enter an expense amount, which must also be entered as a float. The user will 
be asked to enter a category of spending which may be made any category of the users 
choice. The user will be prompted to enter a date, and then will be asked whether they 
want to have a sum displayed, which must take an entry Y or N. 
    If N is chosen the program will stop asking for entries, and display a summary of 
the inputs entered, which includes all the entries of the user, as well as an earnings
category which summarizes the users total gain for the entry. 
    If Y is chosen, the user will be prompted to enter two more dates: the start and 
end date of the desired summary. Once entered in correct formating [ex. 02/22/2002], 
the program will end running and display a summary of the entry, along with the summary 
of earnings between the specified amounts. 
    The program will continue to run and ask for entries.
